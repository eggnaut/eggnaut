<h1> Hello, I'm Dishant B. </h1>

### About:
Hello! You may know me as @eggnaut, but that's just a username. There's a lot more! I'm a 13 year old boy (he/him) who likes to code. I like to do other things than code, like play soccer and watch movies with my family. My favorite language is Python. I like to develop games and have recently started getting into web dev and software dev. I've begun to get into open source because I want to build software with a community.
