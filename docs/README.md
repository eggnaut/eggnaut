### About Me:
Hello! You may know me as @eggnaut, but that's just a username. There's a lot more! I'm a 13 year old boy (he/him) who likes to code. I have other hobbies (apart from coding), like playing soccer and watching movies with my family. My favorite programming language is Python. I like to develop games and have recently started getting into web dev and software dev. I've begun to get into open source because I want to build software with a community.

You can visit my website [here](https://eggnaut.github.io).
